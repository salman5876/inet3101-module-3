## üìñ Overview
This repository contains my work for **Module 3 Lab** in INET3101.  
The assignment focused on practicing C programming concepts such as:
- Static vs. dynamic memory allocation
- Pointers and arrays
- Use of `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`
- Organizing code with header files and multiple source files
- Following and modifying example programs to understand memory behavior

I completed each numbered example from the instructor‚Äôs repository, as well as the activities in the `header-examples` directory. Screenshots, code modifications, and explanations are documented in the included lab report.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Code
1. Install a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
   - **Linux / macOS:**  
     ```bash
     gcc -Wall -Wextra -o program exercises/1-usesstaticarray.c
     ./program
     ```
   - **Windows (PowerShell, MinGW):**  
     ```powershell
     gcc -Wall -Wextra -o program.exe exercises/1-usesstaticarray.c
     .\program.exe
     ```

2. Replace `1-usesstaticarray.c` with any of the other exercise filenames to build and run those examples.

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes
By completing this lab I gained practical experience with:
- How memory is allocated and freed in C
- The differences between static arrays and dynamic memory
- Why proper use of `malloc`/`free` is critical
- Organizing projects with headers and multiple files
- Using GitHub to version-control and share coursework
